    HTML/CSS

    See example screenshots

    INSTRUCTIONS
        Create a responsive tile/grid Layout with graphics/icons
            Create your own HTML and CSS structure
                Create necessary CSS folder(s) using whatever method you are comfortable with SASS/LESS/CSS
            include at least 4 tiles/items
            Include a heading, paragraph and graphic/icon for each tile
            Entire tile should have a hover state
                Graphic/Icon should respond to hover state
            Layout should never cause horizontal scrolling
            Layout should be usable at any screen width and should support at least major browsers/devices

    NOTES
        It is not important to follow the design in the screenshot exactly
            Icons/graphic in screenshots are SVG but SVGs are not required
                PNGs or other are acceptable but should be clean and not take a long time to load
                Add any local assets to the project folder
            If using SASS or LESS, use a preprocessor compatible with Visual Studio 2017
